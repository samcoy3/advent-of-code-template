This module contains a series of miscellaneous utility functions that I have found helpful in the past.

-- Takes a list.
-- Returns a map from elements of that list to the number of times they appeared in the list.
freq :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Map a Int
freq = Map.fromListWith (+) . fmap (,1)

-- Takes a nested list (to be thought of as a 2D structure).
-- Returns a map from "co-ordinates" to the items in the list.
-- For example:
--     Input: [[a,b,c],[d,e]]
--     Output: Map.fromList [((0,0),a), ((0,1),b), ((0,2),c), ((1,0),d), ((1,1),e)]

-- Splits a list into chunks of the specified size.
-- The final chunk may be smaller than the chunk size.
-- Chunk size must be positive.
